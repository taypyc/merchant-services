I applied to B2B Canada and within the next hour I had a wonderful representative contact me and show me my options. I was able to find the right working capital for my business and got the funds in my account just in time for payroll. Thank you B2B Canada!</p>

                                      <p><strong>I will definitely use B2B Canada again</strong><br>My ice cream shop was in dire need of a new fridge, but I didnâ€™t have the money for it. I figured I would try to apply for working capital financing. I went on the B2B Canada website and applied. The next day I was already in the works of getting funded. The agent understood the urgency and made sure that I got my funds asap. I was able to purchase my new fridge and keep my shop open.</p>

                                      <p><strong>My business has expanded!</strong><br>Before I found B2B Canada, my business was really struggling. I need new printers and could not save enough money to purchase them. B2B Canada not only found me the working capital I needed to buy my printers, but also allows me renew with them. Since working with B2B Canada I have been able to buy more equipment and expanding my business by bringing in new customers. I will appreciate B2B!</p>

B2B Canada reviewed my business and approved me for working capital which helped me not only keep my business open but allowed me hire 5 more employees and grow my profits. They assured my business will be passed on to my children as I always hope it would. Thank you so much B2B Canada!</p>
